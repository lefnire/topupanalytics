### Tight, Elegant Code
Always keep code as tight and elegant as possible.

* Think through the logic being introduced and focus aggressively on minimal LoC. 
* Refactor code to reduce bloat and redundancy. Re-use existing variables and code blocks.
* Use elegant and clever shortcuts, both architecturally and through TypeScript features. 
* Use NPM packages to reduce code. If one's not installed, install it.
* Look for one opportunity in *existing code* (beyond anything you introduce) to apply the above.
