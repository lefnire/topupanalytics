* Always keep things as tight as possible. Think through the logic being introduced and focus aggressively on keeping lines of code minimal. This means refactoring code to reduce redundancy / re-use existing variables and code blocks; using elegant and clever shortcuts (both architecturally, and through TypeScript / ESNext features); and other practices. Tight, elegant code is vital.
* That also applies to opportunities you may see in existing code. Don't hesitate to refactor, clean up, tighten anything you notice along the way.
* If you hit a linting or TypeScript error, spend no more than 3 cycles trying to fix it, then move on.
