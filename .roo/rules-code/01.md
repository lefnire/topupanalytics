### General Practices
* If you hit a linting or TypeScript error, spend no more than 3 cycles trying to fix it, then move on.
* Indentation: 2 spaces.
* Remove stale comments. These are comments which seem to reference something that's no longer true of the current code.
* Ensure every generated or modified source code file features an accurate top-level comment block detailing its core purpose and any architecturally significant aspects not immediately obvious from the code structure (e.g., its role in the system, key design rationale, non-trivial dependencies, complex interaction patterns). If a comment block exists, meticulously update it to reflect all changes made, correct inaccuracies, and incorporate missing context. If no block exists, add one, especially for files exhibiting significant complexity or performing critical architectural functions.
