* Always consult @/README.md before starting tasks, to better understand the project.
* When you're done with a changeset, if there were major architectural changes, update README.md, both to keep it correct based on changes, and to fill in knowledge gaps for future agents.
* If you think the request needs thinking through, always use Architect to generate the game plan.
